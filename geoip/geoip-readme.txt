Simple Stats uses the Maxmind GeoLite Country database for Geolocation. 

The database itself is not included in this repository (although it is included in the packaged zip download), but can be downloaded freely from http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry. The database is updated roughly once a month. 

Place the GeoIP.dat file in this directory to enable Geolocation in Simple Stats.
